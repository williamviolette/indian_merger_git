 The CMIE database is not well suited for understanding firm entry and exit because firms are under no
legal obligation to report to the data collecting agency. However, since Prowess contains only the largest
Indian firms, entry and exit is not necessarily an important margin for understanding these firms.

the acquirer and the target, jointly have:
§ Test 1: India Asset Test and India Turnover Test - in
India (i) assets higher than INR 2,000 crore; or (ii)
turnover higher than INR 6,000 crore; or
§ Test 2: Global Asset Test and Global Turnover
Test - Total assets in India or outside higher than
USD 1 billion of which assets in India should be
higher than INR 1,000 crores; or (ii) total turnover
in India or outside is higher than USD 3 billion
